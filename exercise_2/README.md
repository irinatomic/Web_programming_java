Create a chat application using Java sockets that facilitates public communication among all connected users.

- Establishing a server to manage client connections, where each client must have a unique username.
- Allowing clients to view message history, send new messages, and receive real-time updates on incoming messages, like a group chat.
- Implementing message censorship, where certain words are replaced with asterisks.
- Ensuring error handling to maintain the integrity of the communication system.
